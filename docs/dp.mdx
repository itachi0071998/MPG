## Basic concept

Now comes one of the most feared topics of competitive programming but also one of the most interesting and useful. To optimise the time complexity of your code can sometimes be the most challenging task at hand and that is when you will start looking to optimise your code with the help of Dynamic Programming. So how does dynamic programming help you in optimisation of your code? What are the trade offs? When, where and how to apply dynamic programming? If these are the questions that come to your mind, then donâ€™t worry, you are at the correct place, all your queries will be answered, read and learn from these wonderful articles. It is recommended that you go through each till the end.

:::tip
Applying DP to a problem starts with looking at the choices that you can make that will take you from one definite state to another, then you must define and give a meaningful definition to your state. Sometimes these choices are clearly given in a problem, but sometimes you have to figure out the choices you can make.

## State Space Reduction

DP is an optimisation technique, but there is a second level optimisation to DP as well and it is called state space reduction where you eliminate the unnecessary elements from your DP state. Constraints on a problem can be tough sometimes so adding unnecessary elements to your state will still give you a TLE, to avoid it you must continue reading to know about it.
